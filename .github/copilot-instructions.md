# Copilot Instructions for FPGA Pin Planner

## Project Overview
This is a TypeScript-based FPGA Pin Planner GUI tool with VS Code extension support.

## Build Instructions

### 🚀 Automated Build Scripts (RECOMMENDED)
**Always use these automated scripts to avoid manual build errors:**

#### Full Clean Build + Install (Production)
```bash
# Recommended for releases and major changes
npm run build:full
```

#### Quick Development Build
```bash
# For fast iterations during development
npm run build:quick
```

#### Extension-Only Build
```bash
# When only extension code changed
npm run build:extension-only
```

#### Manual Installation Only
```bash
# Install already built extension
npm run install:extension
```

### 📂 Alternative Script Execution
```bash
# PowerShell direct execution
./scripts/full-build-install.ps1

# Batch file (double-click or command line)
./scripts/full-build-install.cmd

# Quick development build
./scripts/quick-build.ps1
```

### ⚠️ Manual Build (NOT RECOMMENDED)
Only use manual builds for debugging script issues:

#### Main Application Build
```bash
npm run build
```

#### VS Code Extension Build
When building the VS Code extension manually, **always perform a clean build**:

```bash
# Navigate to the extension directory
cd vscode-extension

# CRITICAL: First build the main application to ensure latest changes
cd ..
npm run build
cd vscode-extension

# Clean previous build artifacts
rm -rf out/ dist/ node_modules/.cache/

# Install dependencies (if needed)
npm install

# Clean build and package (uses automated webview sync)
npm run package
```

**Important**: Manual builds are error-prone. Always prefer automated scripts to avoid:
- Stale TypeScript compilation artifacts
- Cached module resolution issues
- Mixed build environments
- Inconsistent packaging results
- **OLD WEBVIEW CONTENT** - The most common issue!
- Forgotten build order (main app → extension)

### Critical Build Order
1. **ALWAYS build main app first**: `npm run build` (in root directory)
2. **Then build extension**: `npm run package` (in vscode-extension directory)
3. The extension build automatically syncs the latest webview content

### Extension Installation
The automated scripts handle installation automatically. For manual installation:
```bash
code --install-extension fpga-pin-planner-1.0.x.vsix --force
```

**Note**: Use `--force` flag to overwrite previous installations

## Development Guidelines

### Key Components
- **Main App**: `src/App.tsx` - Main application logic
- **Pin Components**: `src/components/common/PinItem.tsx` - Pin display and interaction
- **Differential Pair Utils**: `src/utils/differential-pair-utils.ts` - Differential pin logic
- **VS Code Extension**: `vscode-extension/` - Extension source code

### Recent Features
- Differential pin sorting: When a differential pin is selected in the viewer, its pair partner automatically appears as the second item in the list
- Visual indicators for differential pair partners
- Enhanced pin selection and sorting logic

### Build Process
1. **Main application build creates optimized production assets** (`dist/` directory)
2. **Extension build automatically copies webview assets** from `dist/` to `webview-dist/`
3. **Extension compiles TypeScript** and packages everything into `.vsix` file
4. **Always follow proper build order**: main app → extension
5. Test both standalone web version and VS Code extension after changes
Use the latest webview content to build the extension. Old build artifacts can cause issues.

### Webview Synchronization
The extension uses automated scripts to sync webview content:
- `copy-webview`: Copies latest build from `../dist/*` to `webview-dist/`
- `build`: Runs clean → copy-webview → compile in sequence
- `package`: Runs full build → vsce package

## Troubleshooting

### 🔧 Automated Build Issues
If automated scripts fail:
```bash
# Try clean build with verbose output
npm run build:full

# Or check individual steps
npm run build        # Main app only
npm run build:quick  # Quick rebuild
```

### 🐛 Manual Build Troubleshooting (Fallback)
- **If extension behaves unexpectedly**: Check if main app was built first
- **If new features don't appear**: Verify webview-dist contains latest assets
- **If extension won't load**: Perform clean build and check for TypeScript errors
- **If old behavior persists**: Use `npm run build:full` for complete clean build
- Check for TypeScript compilation errors in both main app and extension
- Verify that webview assets are properly bundled in the extension package

### ⚠️ Common Issues
1. **Forgot to build main app first** → Use automated scripts to avoid this
2. **Cached build artifacts** → `npm run build:full` cleans everything
3. **Missing --force flag** → Automated scripts include this flag
4. **JSON syntax errors** → Extension fails to load
5. **Old webview content** → Always use `npm run build:full` for clean builds

### 📋 Build Script Benefits
- ✅ **Automatic build order**: Main app → Extension
- ✅ **Complete cleanup**: Removes all cached artifacts
- ✅ **Webview sync**: Ensures latest content in extension
- ✅ **Auto-installation**: Installs with --force flag
- ✅ **Error prevention**: Eliminates manual step mistakes
- ✅ **Time saving**: One command does everything
